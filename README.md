-- Very small study - React + Dotnet9: displays a table with an accounts and items.
-- Backend in the rec-back2 folder

Current WIP:
-- Add account screen where items are diplayed
-- Add simple reconciliation engine that matches transactions on ID
-- Add dark mode

Disclaimer: this is an ongoing study, 100% of the code is hand written, without the help of LLMs, so it probably looks terrible.
